# MongoDB $in Operator with String ObjectIds

This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator is intended to be used with an array of ObjectIds, but in this case, it's provided with an array of strings, which will not correctly query the database.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a query that uses the `$in` operator with an array of strings representing ObjectIds. This leads to unexpected results or no results at all.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected query, converting the strings to ObjectIds before using them with `$in` operator.

## How to reproduce

1.  Create a MongoDB collection named `myCollection` with a few documents containing ObjectIds.
2.  Run the code in `bug.js`, you will notice it does not return the expected documents.
3.  Run the corrected code in `bugSolution.js`, verifying the expected documents are returned.
